# MicroWaveDeviceInventory

### Purpose
- This application provides cached device information, including Capability, Configuration and Historical Performance information.  
- The MicroWaveDeviceInventory shall periodically retrieve the entire data tree from the microwave device and update individual attributes based on value change notifications in between.  
- The MicroWaveDeviceInventory shall massively accelerate response time for providing live data and reduce load on device controllers.  
- It is a precondition for many other applications.
