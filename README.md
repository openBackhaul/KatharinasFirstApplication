# MicroWaveDeviceInventory
This application provides cached device information, including Capability, Configuration and Historical Performance information.  
The MicroWaveDeviceInventory shall periodically retrieve the entire data tree from the microwave device and update individual attributes based on value change notifications in between.  
The MicroWaveDeviceInventory shall massively accelerate response time for providing live data and reduce load on device controllers.  
It is a precondition for many other applications.
