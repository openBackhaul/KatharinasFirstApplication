\t - For the first step it was decided not to have indiviual forwardings for each ressource path. 
\t - if the ressource path request is called with the fields filter, the filter is included in the <i>list-of-other-parameters-relevant-to-respective-path</i>, as the fields
\t - filter is a query parameter and, thus, not a fixed part of the ressource path in the MWDI spec
\t - if the path starts with /cache the data is read from ElasticSearch; paths starting with /live will fetch data from the Controller instead
