        ## 1) provide list of all mount-names the mwdi has cached information for
        ## 2) provide the state (date+time) of the last control construct retrieval (without parameter: for all cached devices, with mount-name as query-parameter: only for the specified NE)
        ## 3) service to initiate a CC update after a device change has occurred (currently there's no other webservice to send a notification -> so for now provide this service explicitly as a callable service)
        ## 4) service to initiate the retrieval of a complete CC (e.g. when a new NE becomes available)

        ## 
        ## there are the following 2 possible update scenarios:
        ## a) a new device is mounted on the controller
        ## b) there is a change in a control construct attribute (or multiple ones)
        ##
        ## for a) this does not require offering a new service here to be called, instead: the MountingOrchestrator
        ##        will send a notification to the MWDI (with mount-name) and this triggers the CC retrieval for said mount-name
        ##        will be specified in the forwardingList
        ##
        ## for b) the MWDI offers a service to other applications to update data inside an device's cached control construct
        ##        if one/multiple attribute value(s) change, said apps should call that request and provide a list of (key,value) pairs for all changed attributes
        ##        together with the mount-name of the device.
        ##        this will be a POST request (all other services offered by are just GET services)
        ##
        ## (b) takes the mount-name plus information about changed CC attributes as input
