<u> Controller connection info:</u>
\t- For requesting information from other applications first <i>RO://v1/list-applications</i> would have to be executed to fetch {ApplicationName, ReleaseNumber, IpAddress, TcpPort}, 
\t  as the connection information may change during runtime.
\t-  When the MWDI sends requests to the Controller, however, this information needs to be added in the MWDI manually, because the Controller is not part of the 
\t  ApplicationFramework (no entries in RO!). 
\t-  In future releases there may be the CurrentController app which has the purpose of just providing the connection information of the Controller from within the AppFramework.
\t-  Also note: instead of providing directly the Controller connection details, the loadbalancer (distributes load across the available controller VMs) could be addressed.

<u> Notification to subscribers about new device:</u>
\t  - the subscriber app (XX, as it's not known at specification time) needs to implement <i>/v1/regard-availability-of-new-device</i>
\t  - subscriber apps can see how to do that by looking at the related callbacks in the MWDI OAS 
\t  - information about subscriber apps is stored and managed by <i>MDWI://v1/notify-availability-of-new-device</i> [mwdi-1-0-0-op-s-is-000]

<u> Device subscriptions:</u>
\t- subscriptions to the device are done according to ODL user guide: [[https://docs.opendaylight.org/projects/netconf/en/latest/user-guide.html#receiving-netconf-device-notifications-on-a-http-client]]
\t- the subscription for device changes are also managed on the Controller; once a device is removed from the Controller the related stream will also be closed; the operations are idempotent
\t- to unsubscribe just stop listening to the streams
